My name is Brian Ward. I'm a photographer, gamer, ultimate player, and web developer based in Boulder, Colorado. My passions include trivia, podcasts, running, and eSports. I graduated Connecticut College in 2018 with a BA in Computer Science. Since then, I have tried my hand at careers in entertainment, photography, and hospitality, finally circling back to software development. Thanks to the DU Coding bootcamp, I have curated a portfolio of my projects to browse at your leisure. ðŸ˜€
